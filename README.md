ðŸŽ¯ About This Portfolio

This portfolio showcases a series of physics-based modeling and simulation projects using Python. Each project demonstrates how core physical principles can be turned into computational models and visualized with clarity. These examples are designed to highlight:
	â€¢	Scientific rigor in problem formulation and derivation
	â€¢	Clear code organization with step-by-step documentation
	â€¢	Professional visualization of physical phenomena
	â€¢	Interpretability and insight, bridging theory with real-world engineering


â¸»

ðŸ§° Tools and Libraries Used
	â€¢	Python 3.10+
	â€¢	NumPy (numerical computing)
	â€¢	Matplotlib (visualization)
	â€¢	Jupyter Notebook (interactive analysis)

âœ¨ Goals of This Portfolio
	â€¢	Build a strong bridge between physics theory and computational modeling
	â€¢	Showcase applied math and engineering thinking in clean, testable Python code
	â€¢	Help others (students, engineers, researchers) learn from open, reproducible examples
