ðŸŽ¯ About This Portfolio

This portfolio showcases a series of physics-based modeling and simulation projects using Python. Each project demonstrates how core physical principles can be turned into computational models and visualized with clarity. These examples are designed to highlight:
	â€¢	Scientific rigor in problem formulation and derivation
	â€¢	Clear code organization with step-by-step documentation
	â€¢	Professional visualization of physical phenomena
	â€¢	Interpretability and insight, bridging theory with real-world engineering
